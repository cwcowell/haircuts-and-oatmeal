# Haircuts and Oatmeal

This is an *extremely simple* algorithmic trading program. It doesn't do actual trading -- it's just a tool for figuring out how well algorithmic trading would have worked, using historical pricing data.

The name is a highly bastardized version of a concept from a Shel Silverstein poem, in which he claims "Daddy spends all his money on haircuts and oatmeal." I'm probably remembering that 98% wrong, but it's become a family meme around my house.
